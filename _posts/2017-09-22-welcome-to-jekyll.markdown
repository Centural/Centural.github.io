Personally I plan to spend more time developing a statc github pages site with either a [Disqus][link_disqus] comment/forum or [Discord][link_discord].
Disqus would be less work overall as I have found documentation on how to setup a forum with this third party application.
Discord on the other hand would require a ground up client side javascript file to handing sending and receiving information to the channel... Not entirely sure if a forum/chatroom would be possible with the current developer api avaliable however it does seem possible. (Keep in mind this is on a static site so all requests would need to run first on page load, receive JSON data back, and have some sort of Discord bot on the other side able to send message to) 

Personally I would prefer to setup Discord but if it seems to take longer than a week I will simple setup a Disqus forum and migrate the date at a later date.

In other news, Minecraft recently update to support cross platform compatibility which is wonderful! We should be expecting a larger player base with this recent update :)
